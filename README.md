- 👋 Hi, I’m @elastutofran. A 23 year old guy that is figuring out what to do (as most of us do). 
- 👀 I’m interested in arts, cinema, acting, video editing, writing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code my first web page. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on movie productions haha. Jk, I'm really just into learning about this coding world and all its branches.
- 📫 How to reach me: you'll know soon enough.
